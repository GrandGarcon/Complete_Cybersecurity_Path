## resources from some of the competitions /tools  on the rev engineering and obfuscation.

### competition :-  completing the codebreaker competition :- 
this is the competition started by the NSA to crack the apps by getting the information about the network packets using the reverse engineering the associateion with the android based application and the access . the  frameworks and tech stacks being referenced here are follows 
    -  radare.
    - Gidra
    - wireshark 

Given below the tutorials can help in understanding the diffrent concepts of the frameworks and the analysis of the payload :

- wireless packet analysis  using wireshark :- [book on the tutorial](http://index-of.es/Varios-2/Practical%20Packet%20Analysis%20Using%20Wireshark%20to%20Solve%20Real%20World%20Problems.pdf)

-  understanding the python libraries like scapy for defining the payload of the TCP/IP , IoT protocols and other formats from scratch
