# Advanced Exploit Development for Penetration Testers :

this intresting course will improve and curate the fundamental skills for exploit development and understand vulns at fundamental leval and leveraging the tools to work on the following tools for ex :
    - writing  modern exploits on Windows family and Azure 
    - Complex attacks on kernel /  memory level including use-after-free , driver exploitation and one day exploitation via patch analysis .
    - utlising various automation frameworks via scripting ( debuggers , msf , plugins ).
    - scale your understanding on cloud level inrastructure security 
    - dealing with modern exploit mitigation controls and come up with better alternatives . 


starting with the revision on the RE tools IDA / Gidhra and then considering their automation capablities for bug hunting and analysis.


## Section 1:   Understanding IDA and some associaed plugins to do static and functional dynamics . 

 - SDLC , threat modelling , tutorials on all the functionalities , extensiblity and automation of the functionality. 

- 1.1 [Starting from the page providing the genral purpose tutorial of the primitive datastructure and scaling up to major projects](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/)

    -  IDA for owrking with packed executables.
        -  issues starts with the files with headers and other ELF / other OS dependent file structure being corrupted to the level that paid tools cant even recognise them .  and specially their issues concerning non resolution of the jmp addresses .

        - start with the manual loading of the library , this will be allowing to set the limits on the memory to be decompiled  and checking some unusual coe ( like having jmp instruction in header ).


        - After esthablishing the relation between the  address , we can define the procedure to  define that the chunk will be defined as function. 


        - define the break points , then recursively opening the maincontent , substituting the opcodes with the operation and  the data to be considered for the reverse compilation . 

    - IDC : an C like language for automating the testing predefined by the user.
        - it starts with the defining of the preprocessor symbol for defining the type of the executable file .





    - debugging  for Ios applications 
        - using the debugging enviornment for diffrent  debuggers :GDB , XNU , iOS debugger . 
        -  start with the source level debugging by rebuilding the idatest application which is being given as the test template by the IDA .
