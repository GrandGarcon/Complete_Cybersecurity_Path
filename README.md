# Complete_Cybersecurity_Path
the open source way to  do the excercises to be a Full-Stack Cybersecurity Engineer. added with the recent paper in the field of Machine learning and cybersecurity. for more info about theis path :- https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-skills-roadmap/
## general overview of attack surfaces waiting for disruption 
1 [Financial market attacks](https://www.swift.com/resource/how-cyber-attackers-could-target-worlds-financial-markets)
<br>2. [security markets , having close to 2x the US gdp traded each year ](https://www.issanet.org/e/pdf/2018-10_ISSA_Cyber_Risk_in_Securities_Services.pdf)

## for beginners , this book  will be sufficient to get started:-  https://github.com/hija/MalwareDataScience

## some nice papers for  Cybersecurity research 
1.  [a nice paper on using crypto for avoiding adversarial attacks on  dnn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01715.pdf)
  - [X] Implementation work to be 
   
2. [a  paper showing the Embedded supplychain  hardware  attacks ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02770)

3. [Attacks on Air gapped  Networks  from Negev university ](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Guri-AirGap.pdf)

# Now practical  work :- 
### 1..some of the practical paths suggessted by SANS courses ( thanks for that  but the cost is quite high)

### 2. compeittion :-  completing the codebreaker competition :- 
this is the competition started by the NSA to crack the network packets  and then the mobile app stepwise so as to utilise the knowledge from the SANS tutorials. its to be very challanging competition :- 
  - 

### 2.1 wireless packet analysis :- using wireshark :- [book on the tutorial](http://index-of.es/Varios-2/Practical%20Packet%20Analysis%20Using%20Wireshark%20to%20Solve%20Real%20World%20Problems.pdf)
  
  
  
  ### 2.2 creating networking packets :- 

    2.2.1  scapy  tutorial and the various techniques for getting the resulting architecture of firewall ids.


### course on the reverse engineering and obfuscation on linux and embedded architecture 



### Some good links for communities 
1. For the CTF and other experiences:- 0x00sec
then for the practical , reading RE book 0xA reverse engineering linux is the bible for those who really want to learning the CA & OS at same time and also write low level but standardized code ( wish i have known this site rather than sitting hours & hrs in boring repeated classes).



### some open standards :
1. MISP : getting the collaboration information sharing  for malware analysis and threat intelligence . check its compatiblity and diffrence with the TAXII and other protocols .


###  Cybersec-DevOPS: 
1. the automated patching management system on the scales of thousands of servers ( like oracle autonomous linux service) is a great start to really check the  Linux admin stuff and the principles of site reliablity engineering so as to work on the automating the patch management and also checking the file systems  by the automation of the file reverse engineering . 


# To Do List

- [X] writing the minimum viable project and resources
  - for the starting solve questions only from CTF365 / HTB  with one problem each day from diffrent type.
  
- [ ] Implementing the recent Ml papers with cybersecurity (currently not my cup of tea , any contrbutions will be welome)
  - 


-[X]  Excercises and resource on professional courses 

###   yellow pages  of infosec world:
  -1 rmusser.net :https://docs.rmusser.net/
    1.1  making a complete course on this with the tutorials on notion[ ]. 
    1.2 deploy them using the concepts of extremeDevOPS ( Ci + CD + testing + code formatting / reviewing in real time ) :https://blog.yourlabs.org/posts/2020-02-08-bigsudo-extreme-devops-hacking-operations/ .
